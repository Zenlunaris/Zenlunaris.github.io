## Research

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Zuckerman Institute, Columbia working with Liam Paninski. My research interests lie at the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning where I focus on improving and applying deep generative models, analyzing large-scale neural recordings, and developing novel software tools for running and benchmarking automated spike sorters. Recently, I have been expanding my research to dynamical models of neural population recordings.
